# ORCA-C
Apple IIGS ORCA/C Compiler, an ANSI C compiler for the 65816 with libraries for the Apple IIGS

If you would like to make changes to this compiler and distribute them to others, feel free to submit them here. If the changes apply to compilation on and for an Apple IIGS, they will generally be approved for distribution on the master branch unless the changes deviate significantly from the ANSI C standard. For changes that deviate form ANSI C or changes that retarget the compiler to run on a different platform or generate code for a different platform, the project will either be forked or a new repository will be created, as appropriate.

The general conditions that must be met before a change is released on master are:

1. The modified compiler must compile under the currently released version of ORCA/M and ORCA/Pascal.

2. All samples from the original ORCA/C distribution must compile and execute under the modified compiler, or the sample must be updated, too.

3. The compiler must pass the ORCA/C tset suite, or the test suite must be suitably modified, too.

4. The compiler must work with the current ORCA/C libraries, or the libraries must be modified, too.

Contact support@byteworks.us if you need contributor access.

A complete distribution of the ORCA languages, including installers and documentation, is available from the Juiced GS store at https://juiced.gs/store/category/software/. It is distributed as part of the Opus ][ package.
